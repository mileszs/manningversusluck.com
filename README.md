# Manning Versus Luck

The site manningversusluck.com will primarily consist of charts plotting Manning's stats versus Andrew Luck's stats year by year, starting with Manning's rookie season in 1998 compared to Luck's rookie season in 2012. It will compare various statistics, such as interceptions, completion percentage, and a couple of the various QB rating algorithms.

## Dude, Why?

Why am I doing this? A bit out of curiosity as a football fan, a bit out of curiosity as a programmer, and a bit to tweak all of those people who are extremely emotionally invested in one of these players. (Most often, here in Indianapolis, this means people who, regardless of the consequences to the franchise, believe the Colts should have retained Manning in 2012, instead of cutting him on March 8th.)

If you hate me for doing this, well, that probably makes two of us, to an extent. Pardon my giggling, though. I hope it doesn't bother you. Hehe!
