      <h1>Manning Versus Luck</h1>

      <p>The site manningversusluck.com will primarily consist of
      charts plotting Manning's stats versus Andrew Luck's stats year
      by year, starting with Manning's rookie season in 1998 compared
      to Luck's rookie season in 2012. It will compare various
      statistics, such as interceptions, completion percentage, and a
      couple of the various QB rating algorithms.</p>

      <h2>Dude, Why?</h2>

      <p>Why am I doing this? A bit out of curiosity as a football
      fan, a bit out of curiosity as a programmer, and a bit to tweak
      all of those people who are extremely emotionally invested in
      one of these players. (Most often, here in Indianapolis, this
      means people who, regardless of the consequences to the
      franchise, believe the Colts should have retained Manning in
      2012, instead of cutting him on March 8th.) Incidentally, turns
      out the programmer-curiosity-angle is pretty uninteresting.
      That just leaves football fan curiosity, and wanting to piss
      you off. I guess I'm a jerk.</p>

      <p>If you hate me for doing this, well, that probably makes two
      of us, to an extent. Pardon my giggling, though. I hope it
      doesn't bother you. Hehe!</p>

      <h2>Tech</h2>

      <p>At this time, we're talking about
      <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">HighCharts</a>, and
      hardcoded data from
      <a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MannPe00/gamelog//">pro-football-reference.com</a>. </p>

      <h2>Contact Me</h2>

      <p>You are welcome (until it becomes a problem, which will
      probably happen when some local radio personality gets ahold of
      this, and proceeds to explain why I'm a horrible person on air)
      to <a href="mailto:miles@mileszs.com">email me here</a>.</p>
